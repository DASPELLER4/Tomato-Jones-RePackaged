# Tomato-Jones-RePackaged

This is just a sys call with the contents:

    Ball.exe ..\\_data\\chapters\\SS.blend

# Installation
1. copy the .exe file into the system folder in the Tomato Jones steam directory, if using the release remove the first dot in the filename and add a space in place.

2. <h2>If using other versions of the game like tomato jones 2 or 3</h2>
   rename the exe to Tomato Jones II.exe or Tomato Jones III.exe

3. FINAL STEP, VERY IMPORTANT: enjoy :)

# Make yourself
   
Compile the Tomato Jones.c file in any c compiler you want as long as it outputs a windows .exe file, name the output to Tomato Jones.exe or Tomato Jones II.exe or Tomato Jones III.exe according to your game version and copy and replace the file in the steam Tomato Jones/system directory
