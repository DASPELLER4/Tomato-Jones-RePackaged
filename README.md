# Tomato-Jones-RePackaged
New Tomato Jones Exe for Linux users on wine

This is just a repackaged .bat file with the contents:

    Ball.exe ..\\_data\\chapters\\SS.blend

That's it, I'll also leave the launcher.bat for you

# Installation
copy the .exe file into the system folder in the Tomato Jones steam directory

FINAL STEP, VERY IMPORTANT: enjoy :)
