# Tomato-Jones-RePackaged
New Tomato Jones Exe for Linux users on wine

This is just a repackaged .bat file with the contents:

    Ball.exe ..\\_data\\chapters\\SS.blend

That's it, I'll also leave the launcher.bat for you if you want to repackage it into an exe to avoid malware, I used https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/bat_to_exe_converter.html for the repackager

# Installation
1. copy the .exe file into the system folder in the Tomato Jones steam directory

2. <h2>If using other versions of the game like tomato jones 2 or 3</h2>
   rename the exe to Tomato Jones II.exe or Tomato Jones III.exe

<br>

FINAL STEP, VERY IMPORTANT: enjoy :)
