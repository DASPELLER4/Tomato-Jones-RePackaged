# Tomato-Jones-RePackaged

# I HAVE TAKEN THE EXE DOWN DUE TO SECURITY CONCERNS WITH THE QUALITY OF THE CONVERTER,<a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/a1c96a1f1cbd63834add19e330bf213dfbb8478d41e1a833b6c37fff86f945ca/detection">Virus Total</a>

New Tomato Jones Exe for Linux users on wine

This is just a repackaged .bat file with the contents:

    Ball.exe ..\\_data\\chapters\\SS.blend

While there is no exe, I would reccommend you to either run the launcher.bat straight from wine, won't work in steam but I can't safely reccommend you a bat to exe converter, work is under way for a stdlib.h edition of the exe that I make myself so there WON'T be malware this time, I'm very sorry for not verifying the safety of that file.

# Installation
1. copy the .exe file into the system folder in the Tomato Jones steam directory, if using the release remove the first dot in the filename and add a space in place.

2. <h2>If using other versions of the game like tomato jones 2 or 3</h2>
   rename the exe to Tomato Jones II.exe or Tomato Jones III.exe

<br>

3. FINAL STEP, VERY IMPORTANT: enjoy :)

# Make yourself

Compile the Tomato Jones.c file in any c compiler you want as long as it outputs a windows .exe file, name the output to Tomato Jones.exe or Tomato Jones II.exe or Tomato Jones III.exe according to your game version and copy and replace the file in the steam Tomato Jones/system directory
